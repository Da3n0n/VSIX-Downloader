This is a Chrome Extension to Download VSIX ( Visual Studiod Extension Packages ) directlly from the web 

why ? becasue when you clcik install it defualts to install in VS Code and catn download the package directly 

Microsoft has recently removed the VS Code Marketplace from 3rd party IDE like Cursor , Trae , Windsurf etc so this extension alows you tio easily download the extensions form the webpage and install them manaully in any IDE you choose :)
