This is a Chrome Extension to Download VSIX ( Visual Studio Extension Packages ) directlly from the web @ https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/

why ? becasue when you clICK install it defualts to install in VS Code and cant download the package directly.

Microsoft has recently removed the VS Code Marketplace availability from 3rd party IDE's like Cursor , Trae , Windsurf etc so this extension allows you to easily download the extensions directly from the Visual Studio Marketplace webpage and install them manaully in any IDE you choose after :)
